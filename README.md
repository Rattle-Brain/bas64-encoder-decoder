# bas64-encoder-decoder
This project is a basic b64 encoder/decoder written in Rust.

It'll be proggresively updated and improved over time.

However, it's not intended for real world use, it's just a way for me to practice Rust.

Over time I'll be updating the readme with the usage of the program in case you, the reader, want to test and play with it.
